# moify.me

The moinator, reshorn.

## first things first
Reference a twitter account (e.g. @robdrimmie)

The avatar is collected, and presented as large as possible in the
middle of the screen. Around the periphery, a collection of moustaches
are available. 

Drag and drop one moustache onto the avatar. Scale the moustache.

Save the image, get a dedicated url (e.g.
moify.me/7e09c9d3e96378bf549fc283fd6e1e5b7014cc33 - just a sha1 hash
of in this case "rob" but in other cases maybe something interesting or
maybe something else)

## near future things

- update twitter avatar with button press
- tweet "I've been moified! Moify yourself at http://moify.me!"
